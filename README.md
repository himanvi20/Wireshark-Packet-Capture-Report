# Wireshark-Packet-Capture-Report
This repository contains a packet capture exercise performed with Wireshark.  
The goal was to capture live network traffic, filter it by protocols, and analyze the roles of different protocols in internet communication.

##  Contents
- task_capture.pcap – The captured packet file.
- Wireshark_Packet_Capture_Report.docx – A detailed report summarizing the capture and observed protocols.
- Screenshots – Wireshark screenshots demonstrating filters and protocol views.

##  Tools Used
- *Wireshark* – For packet capture and filtering.
- *Microsoft Word / LibreOffice* – For writing the report.
- *Command Prompt/Browser* – To generate traffic during capture.

##  Protocols Observed
- *TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):* Ensures reliable data transfer between client and server.
- *DNS (Domain Name System):* Translates human-friendly domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses.
- *HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):* Delivers web content (pages, images, resources) from servers to browsers.

##  How to Use
1. Open task_capture.pcap in Wireshark.
2. Apply filters such as tcp, dns, or http to analyze specific traffic.
3. Refer to the report (.docx) for a summary of findings.
